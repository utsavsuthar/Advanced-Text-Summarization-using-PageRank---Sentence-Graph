I was walking down the street.
I met my friends Rayan, George and Seni.
It was a sunny day outside.
We decided to go for a picnic near the lake.
The lake water was cold, but we still went swimming.
The picnic was fun and we played games.
In the evening, we built a bonfire and roasted marshmallows.
The stars were shining brightly in the night sky.
We shared stories and laughed a lot.
Eventually, we fell asleep by the soothing sound of the lake.
